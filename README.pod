=head1 NAME

SocialMAP - A Facebook Connect integrated Geo-Social networking software. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A fresh approach to social networking based on local interactions with real locations on a map.
Additional views into every day search technologies will be made available in time. Under the hood, SocialMAP
uses the Perl based Mojolicious::Lite framework, the JavaScript based Dojotoolkit and the JavaScript based
Google Maps and Facebook Connect API's. This carefully selected group of technologies allows for a feature
rich interface where people can easily interact with one another in ways they never have before using a
unique view into every day internet searching.
